Welcome to today’s lecture on “Modern Approaches in NLP,” presented by Quan Thanh Tho. This topic is crucial in understanding how Natural Language Processing (NLP) has evolved and the different methodologies that are at the forefront of this transformation. Firstly, let's delve into the significance of NLP in the contemporary technological landscape. As we all know, NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, and it's a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. By enabling computers to understand and process human language, NLP opens a myriad of opportunities in various applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and more.

Transitioning to the advancements in NLP, we must consider the journey from traditional rule-based approaches to the data-driven techniques involving machine learning and deep learning. Traditional methods relied heavily on handcrafted rules and linguistic knowledge, which were limited and time-consuming. However, modern methods adopt data-driven approaches using large corpora and sophisticated algorithms to uncover patterns and understand language contextually.

Now, let us segue into the foundational concepts that underline modern NLP approaches. It is crucial to understand the transition from traditional to modern NLP methodologies and the techniques involved in this evolution. From there, we can further explore the core sections of this subject, including supervised learning techniques, neural network architectures, and the application of transformer models such as BERT and GPT-3 in revolutionizing NLP tasks.

In the forthcoming slides, we'll dive deeper into each category, starting with the basic principles and moving towards more complex and current applications in the field of NLP. Moving on, we will also discuss the challenges faced in NLP, such as syntactic ambiguity, semantic understanding, and the scarcity of annotated data, and how modern approaches aim to resolve these issues.

By the end of this lecture series, you should have a solid grasp of modern NLP approaches, enabling you to apply this knowledge effectively in your projects or research. Let’s get started on this exciting journey into the world of Natural Language Processing!
