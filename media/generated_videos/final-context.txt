Welcome to today's lecture on "Modern Approaches in NLP." As we embark on this exciting journey, I want you to imagine the *VAST* landscape of Natural Language Processing - a field that has undergone a *DRAMATIC* transformation in recent years. 

Think about it: just a decade ago, machine translation was clunky and often comical. Now? We're approaching human-level performance in many language pairs. How did we get here? The answer lies in the *INCREDIBLE* advancements we've seen in computational power, data availability, and - perhaps most importantly - algorithmic sophistication.

Now, you might be wondering, "Why should I care about these modern approaches?" Well, let me tell you - understanding these cutting-edge techniques isn't just about impressing your tech-savvy friends at parties (though that's certainly a bonus!). It's about grasping the tools that are *RESHAPING* our world. From the chatbots that handle customer service to the sentiment analysis algorithms influencing stock markets - NLP is *EVERYWHERE*.

As we dive deeper into each concept, I want you to keep one question in mind: "How can I apply this in the real world?" Because that's where the *MAGIC* happens. We're not just here to learn theory - we're here to understand how these innovations are changing the way we interact with language and technology.

So, buckle up! We're about to embark on a journey that will take us to the very forefront of NLP technology. And trust me, it's going to be one *HECK* of a ride!

Now, you've just learned about the *INCREDIBLE* advancements in NLP and why they matter. But who's going to be your guide on this exciting journey? Well, that's where I come in!

I'm Quan Thanh Tho from HCMUT, and I'll be your captain on this voyage through the seas of Natural Language Processing. Now, I know what you're thinking - "Great, another professor with a fancy email address." But hold onto your hats, because this isn't going to be your typical, dry academic lecture!

You see, NLP isn't just my field of expertise - it's my *PASSION*. I eat, sleep, and breathe this stuff. And my goal? To infect you with the same enthusiasm! By the end of this course, I want you to be as excited about neural networks and sentiment analysis as you are about your favorite Netflix series.

Remember how we talked about the real-world applications of NLP in the previous slide? Well, get ready to dive *DEEP* into those applications. We're going to build on that foundation, layer by layer, until you're not just understanding these concepts, but *APPLYING* them in ways you never thought possible.

And here's the best part - this isn't a one-way street. I *WANT* to hear from you! Got a question? Ask it! Had a brilliant idea? Share it! Because that's how we're going to push the boundaries of what's possible in NLP.

So, are you ready to embark on this adventure? Are you prepared to have your mind *BLOWN* by the possibilities of modern NLP? Because I promise you - by the end of this lecture, you'll never look at language the same way again!
