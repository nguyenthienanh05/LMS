Welcome, everyone! Today, we're diving into the *fascinating* world of Modern Approaches in Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short. Now, you might be thinking, "Why should I care about NLP?" Well, let me tell you - it's EVERYWHERE!!! From the moment you wake up and ask your smart speaker about the weather, to the last text you send before bed, NLP is working its magic.

We're going to explore how technology is evolving to understand and process human language better than ever before. Imagine a world where language barriers are a thing of the past, where you can have a conversation with anyone, anywhere, in real-time. That's the power of NLP!

We'll be looking at machine learning techniques, deep learning models, and other cutting-edge methodologies. These aren't just buzzwords, folks - they're the building blocks of a revolution in how we interact with technology and each other.

As we progress through this lecture, I want you to keep one question in mind: How can these advancements in NLP change YOUR daily life? Trust me, by the end of this session, you'll be seeing NLP opportunities everywhere you look!

Now, before we dive deeper, let me introduce myself. I'm Quan Thanh Tho from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, or HCMUT for short. And yes, that email address on the screen? That's your lifeline to more NLP knowledge! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions or just want to geek out about language processing.

You've already gotten a taste of what NLP can do from our introduction. But hold onto your seats, because we're about to take this to a whole new level! We're going to break down these complex concepts step-by-step. Think of it as building a language processing machine in your mind - we'll start with the nuts and bolts and end up with a fully functioning NLP powerhouse!

Remember how we talked about machine learning and deep learning models in the previous slide? Well, we're going to dissect these concepts and see how they form the backbone of modern NLP. And don't worry if you're feeling a bit overwhelmed - I promise we'll make this journey as smooth as a well-trained language model!

As we move forward, I want you to think about how each concept we discuss could be applied in the real world. Maybe you'll come up with the next big NLP innovation! After all, who wouldn't want to be the person who finally gets autocorrect to understand sarcasm, am I right???

So, are you ready to embark on this NLP adventure? Let's dive in and unlock the secrets of language processing together!
